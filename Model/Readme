RapidMiner manages its files in so called repositories which are listed in the "Repositories" tab. 
All files in this repository are stored on your file system. 
To use these files it is sufficient to copy & paste them into the directory on your file system and refresh the repository in RapidMiner (or restart the program).
Enjoy them!
